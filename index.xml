      <description>Articles about learn in public, brag document and free stuffs.
Learn In Public If there’s a golden rule, it’s this one, so I put it first. All the other rules are more or less elaborations of this rule #1.
A habit of creating learning exhaust:
Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets. Speak at meetups and conferences. Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. Avoid the walled gardens like Slack and Discord, they’re not public.</description>

      <description>Hugo? It’s a fast and static website generator written in the Go language. Websites built with Hugo can be hosted anywhere from GitHub Pages to Amazon S3 without any database or other language dependencies.
First I started to use Hugo is for my Malayalam write up a blog wizbi tales (Malayalam is a language spoken in Kerala, India), After the initial learning curves, I loved it for simplicity and performance. And when I started this blog itself I didn’t think twice.</description>

      <description>What is Markdown?
The Markdown Guide is a free and open-source reference guide that explains how to use Markdown, the simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format virtually any document.
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.
Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor.</description>

      <description>Who am I ?! This is the most asked question in my life. Yet no clear answer has yet been found.
As a child, the answer to this question was simple. Say my name to the question of who. Aha ..! Simple and beautiful. In that answer, parents and siblings in adolescence. I thought to myself that the answer was too clear.
When I started asking myself this question at a young age when I was beginning to recognize many things, I began to feel that the answer was becoming less clear.</description>
